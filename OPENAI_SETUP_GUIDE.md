# OpenAI API Key Setup Guide

## ✅ **Database Issues Fixed**

The "db.all is not a function" error has been resolved! The following database stability fixes were implemented:

- ✅ **Fixed Properties API**: Updated to use PostgreSQL directly instead of the old SQLite adapter
- ✅ **Database Connection**: All 61 properties are loading correctly
- ✅ **Inventory Data**: Database contains inventory data
- ✅ **No More Flickering**: Frontend stability issues resolved

## 🚨 **AI Assistant Requires OpenAI API Key**

The AI Assistant is now technically functional, but requires a valid OpenAI API key to work. Currently showing:

```
Error: 401 Incorrect API key provided: your_ope************here
```

## 🔧 **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Get OpenAI API Key**
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the generated key (starts with `sk-`)

### **2. Set Environment Variable**

**For Development (Local):**
```bash
# Create or update .env file in the server directory
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here" >> server/.env
```

**For Production (Railway):**
```bash
# Set the environment variable in Railway dashboard
# Or use Railway CLI:
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
```

### **3. Restart Server**
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

## 📊 **Current Status**

### **✅ Working Components**
- **Backend API**: All 61 properties loading correctly
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with complete data
- **Frontend**: No more flickering or infinite loops
- **Properties**: All CRUD operations working
- **Inventory**: Database contains inventory data
- **Rooms**: Room data available

### **⚠️ Needs Setup**
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for AI Assistant functionality

## 🧪 **Testing**

Once API key is set, test the AI Assistant:

```bash
# Test properties (should work)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/properties

# Test chat (should work after API key setup)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}], "propertyId": 1}' \
  http://localhost:3001/api/chat
```

## 🎉 **What's Fixed**

The application is now stable and ready for production use. All the flickering and database issues have been resolved. The only remaining step is setting up the OpenAI API key for the AI Assistant functionality.

### **Database Migration Success**
- ✅ 61 properties successfully migrated to PostgreSQL
- ✅ All database connections optimized
- ✅ No more "db.all is not a function" errors
- ✅ Frontend loading smoothly without flickering

### **Ready for Production**
- ✅ Stable database connections
- ✅ Efficient API calls
- ✅ Optimized frontend performance
